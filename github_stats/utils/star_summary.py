    Stars don't have individual timestamps in the GitHub API response, so they're tracked
    as current counts rather than individual interaction events.
    
    To get current star counts, the application would need to call:
    `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}` and use the `stargazers_count` field.
    
    This provides more accurate data than synthetic timestamps.
